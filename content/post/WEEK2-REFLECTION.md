# Week 2 Reflection

In week 2, I learnt more stuff about Web Application Security. 

On Friday, everyone did a 3-minute-presentation and many of us hadn't mentioned the problem solution though, and I talked about SQL Injection is one way of injection attack which is regarded as the most dangerous application security risk. Because of almost any source of data can be an injection vector, environment variables, parameters, external and internal web services, and all types of users. Injection flaws occur when an attacker can send hostile data to an interpreter.

The picture above shows a classic way of sql injection that attacker may use the trick 'OR 1=1 --' to get the password even the password has been encrypted with MD5.

## SLO 2: Apply design thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem

● Use problem solving and creative methodologies to identify security vulnerabilities
● Document steps taken to overcome problems adding to the weekly sprint submissions e.g.
a personal blog entry

## SLO 3. Apply technical skills to develop, model and/or evaluate design
● Research security vulnerabilities and exploits and be able to apply this research to evaluate the security state of a system to document attack vectors and their mitigations.

## SLO 4. Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills
● Communicate key impacts and consequences of security vulnerabilities and potential threats with various audiences.
● Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills through active participation on the studio’s Microsoft Teams chat, amongst peers in the classroom and through your online weekly sprint submissions (​not Wordpress, Wix , Weebly or similar​, be creative​).
● Present weekly findings either in groups or as a stand ups to discuss the milestones, challenges, and what roadblocks are encountered.

## 5. Conduct critical self and peer review and performance evaluation
● Utilise weekly feedback forms to aid personal and team growth, areas for improvement, team dynamic, and any discoveries made during this evaluation
● Reflect on the tools and resources required to facilitate self-study and discovery in order to solve security problems
