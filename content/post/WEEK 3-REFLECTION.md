## Let’s break into machines!

Week 3 was awesome!!

On Tuesday I participated SecTalks!

The studio focused on "Break Into Machines", which is pretty exciting and full of challenging. It is really a huge jump from playing wargames, CTFs, and vulnernable web apps. Thanks for research about hacking tools and Piper demo practiced in the class so that I was basiclly what was going on on the VMs.

On Wednesday, our team - Bare Minimum Bandits made the presentation about two tools
One is Wireshark

The other one is CyberChef

## PHP review

I reviewed PHP staments and some notes below

<? php
	This is a single line comment
#	This is a single line comment
/*
	This is a multiple line comment
*/
 You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x =5/* + 15 */+5; (a variable starts with $)
echo $x; ———(output is 10)

echo “This “,”string “,”was “,”made “,”with multiple parameters.”;
print “can only have one argument ”

?>

2. Low cost.
3. Low data rate. The maximum data rate for a ZigBee device is 250Kbps.
4. Easy to implement.
5. Supports up to 65,000 nodes connected in a network.

7. ZigBee uses small packets compared with WiFi and Bluetooth.
