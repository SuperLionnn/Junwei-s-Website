      <description>Introduction My name is Junwei Liang, a 3rd year student in Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering). I am so lucky that I enrolled in the summer studio. In Cyber Security studio, all colleagues are friendly and energetic. Because of I was almost start from zero in Cyber Security, and everyone in the studio helped me a lot on both communication and technical problem solving. So that, I would like to recommend that the Cyber Security summer studio is definitely one of the worthiest elective subjects in UTS.</description>

Reverse Engineering is the skill of figuring out what a black box is doing. This includes being able to figure out what a set of assembly instructions means. This doesn’t mean you have to understand every single instruction. With enough practice you’ll start recognising structures pretty quickly.</description>

The studio focused on &amp;ldquo;Break Into Machines&amp;rdquo;, which is pretty exciting and full of challenging. It is really a huge jump from playing wargames, CTFs, and vulnernable web apps. Thanks for research about hacking tools and Piper demo practiced in the class so that I was basiclly what was going on on the VMs.
On Wednesday, our team - Bare Minimum Bandits made the presentation about two tools One is Wireshark</description>

Firstly, try to find any interesting hidden folders.
These are folders I found: image _image_png/ js css password _password_reset/ login invite _storage_companies/ Error 403: Error 404: Source not found
try input “”
XSRF Protection
Then try https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite/id Code 404 error Try to find some in robots.txt but there is nothing Injection will be blocked https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite/%3CsCript%3Ealert(1);%3C/scRiPt%3E
Look at the source code /inviteapi.min.js. file looks like the key point to get the invite code.</description>
